# Correct Posture Electronic
The goal was to create a device to help improve the user’s body posture and reduce back pain by measuring and providing real-time feedback on the user's sitting angle. Using the M5 Stack Core 2 coupled with the Arduino IDE, we would strap the device to the user’s chest, record a comfortable sitting position, and then monitor the angle continuously and in real-time to ensure it stayed within a 0-30° trunk inclination range from the recorded position. If the user exceeded this range for more than 5 seconds, the device would vibrate and beep as an alert. 

Testing showed that the device adapted well to different body types and effectively alerted users of poor posture.Despite facing challenges in adapting the device to individual physical differences and determining the ideal sitting angle, the project concluded with a successful prototype. Future improvements could focus on user feedback for better customization, reducing the overall device size, and incorporating data recording for long-term posture analysis. This project highlighted the importance of integrating scientific research, user feedback, and practical testing in developing effective biofeedback devices.
