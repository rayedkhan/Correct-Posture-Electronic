# Correct-Posture-Electronic
Created a device using the M5 Stack Core 2 to improve body posture by providing real-time feedback on sitting angles. It adapts to different body types and alerts users of poor posture with vibrations and beeps. Developed a successful prototype, with future enhancements focusing on customization, size reduction, and long-term data recording.
